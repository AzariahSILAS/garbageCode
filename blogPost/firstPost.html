            <h1>okay, what exactly am i doing with garbage code?</h1>
            <p>
                Its a blog, a blog about how I'm learning to code . Not only is it a blog about me learning to code but its also a canvas for me to practice coding on. I'm going to start by writing this blog. Then, I'm going to create a way to access an admin section on my page were i can log in with user information and have a nice user interface with basic customization and a simple to use interface that i can use to create blog post from. The reason I'm doing that is so i can get practice righting code for other people, if i create a blog site for another person, i want them to be able to easily be able to create new blog post without having to code. i also want to make the process easier and faster for myself. after doing that I'm going to make new blog post about my experience building that functionality and how i went about it to kind of keep track and document my learning process. 
                this first bog post is going to be heard coded in that way i can design this as a template for the other blogs to follow, so i will create classes and set up using this blog post.
            </p>
            <h1>What is my goal?</h1>
            <p>
                I'm learning code in general but for now I'm learning webDev, i want to be able to build web apps. simple webapps like, eCommerce's stores information websites portfolios store sites for local stores and business and more but that's just kind of the start. After that, i fell like i will be able to start selling my services.
            </p>
            <h1>where am i at right now with my learning journey?</h1>
            <p>
                i fell like i know to much theory but because of my lack of experience i don't understand or remember most of it, in other words, I've watched enough videos and read enough documentation for a bit, now i need to put the work in and build stuff (A lot of stuff) that's the point of this blog, something to keep me building but also something that is fun and interesting so i stay motivated to keep building!
