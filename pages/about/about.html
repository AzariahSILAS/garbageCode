                    <p> 
                        I am a self taught programmer and though I've come a very long way, its been an extremely tough journey with countless hours and days of stressing, sometimes over things as simple as know how to study. It doesn't seem like a big deal but trust me, that is the point were many give up on this journey and quit. My goal in this blog is to help create a clear path and be someone who can support others on this difficult journey make their experiences a little easier by passing the lessons I've had to learn the hard way!

                    Great question. My plan is to not only give you all the information I've learn over the years in small digestible amounts but I also want to create the path that I would take if I were to start my learning journey over again with the experience I have now.
